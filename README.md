## Overview
**KGHitTestingViews** is a small helper library to **effortlessly increase the hit test area of a view**.

It's common to display buttons as small as 20 x 20 points. However, [iOS User Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/LayoutandAppearance.html) recommends that all tappable controls have at least a 44 x 44 point hit area. A common solution to this problem involves making a large button containing a small image, but this solution impacts positioning constraints relative to the small image and makes the layout generally more awkward. **KGHitTestingViews** aims to solve this problem in a simple manner.

## Installation

To install using [CocoaPods](https://github.com/cocoapods/cocoapods), add the following to your project Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'KGHitTestingViews'
```

Alternatively, drag and drop all of the files in the KGHitTestingViews folder into your Xcode project, agreeing to copy files if needed.

## How to Use

### In Code (Category):
The easiest way to use **KGHitTestingViews** is to use the `UIView` category: `"UIView+KGHitTesting.h"`. No subclassing required!

```objective-c
@interface UIView (KGHitTesting)
- (void)setMinimumHitTestWidth:(CGFloat)width height:(CGFloat)height;
@end
```

### In Code (Subclassing):
Subclass `KGHitTestingView` or `KGHitTestingControl` or `KGHitTestingButton` and set `minimumHitTestHeight` and `minimumHitTestWidth` to the desired size of the hit test area:

```objective-c
@interface ButtonSubclass : KGHitTestingButton
@end
```
```objective-c
- (void)setup {
	self.minimumHitTestWidth = 44.0;
	self.minimumHitTestHeight = 44.0;
}
```

### In Interface Builder (Subclassing):
Subclass `KGHitTestingView` or `KGHitTestingControl` or `KGHitTestingButton` in the "Identify Inspector" and set the width and height values in the "Attributes Inspector."

### Important note: 
The height and width of the hit test area are *minimums*. If you specify a smaller hit area width or height than what the bounds specify, the bounds width or height will be used.

## Swift Support
KGHitTestingViews works with Swift! Just follow the "How to Use" section.

## FAQ
###What is hit testing?

"The process of determining whether a user-controlled cursor (such as a mouse cursor or touch-point on a touch-screen interface) intersects a given graphical object (such as a shape, line, or curve) drawn on the screen." - [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit-testing)

###Why override `-pointInside:`? I thought this is hit testing.
Hit test (`-hitTest:`) is a more-complex algorithmic test that involves looping through subviews. Point inside (`-pointInside:`) is a simple geometric test which checks whether a `CGPoint` is within the bounds of a given view. For the purposes of increasing the touch area, we only need to modify the geometric calculation. For more, check out [this](http://smnh.me/hit-testing-in-ios/) nicely written blog about hit-testing.
